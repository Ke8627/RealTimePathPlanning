This algorithm is *probabilistically complete* and *asymptotically optimal* algorithm like its predecessor RRT. The algorithm has the ability to deal with dynamic obstacles, the planner changes the path if any obstacle appears in the visibility radius of the robot. 

The original paper in which this algorithm was introduced can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301463753_RT-RRT_a_real-time_path_planning_algorithm_based_on_RRT).
